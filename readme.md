# 📘 Quiz Management System (QMS)

A full-stack web application designed for managing quizzes with two user roles: **Faculty** and **Student**. Built using Django REST Framework on the backend and React.js on the frontend, this system handles everything from quiz creation and submission to grading and analytics.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, JWT (SimpleJWT)
- **Frontend:** React.js, Axios, React Router, Context API
- **Others:** Python Dotenv for secure credentials, Basic CSS for styling

---

## 🎯 What This Project Does

This system allows faculty to create quizzes, add questions (both MCQ and subjective), and track student submissions. Students can log in, attempt quizzes with a timer, and view their results. Faculty can also grade subjective answers and export results.

---

## 👥 User Roles

### 👩‍🏫 Faculty
1. Register/Login securely
2. Create, edit, or delete quizzes
3. Add MCQs and subjective questions
4. View all student submissions
5. Grade answers manually if needed
6. View top-scoring students per quiz

### 👨‍🎓 Student
1. Register/Login
2. View all available quizzes
3. Attempt quizzes (with timer)
4. Auto-grade MCQs instantly
5. View results after submission

## 🛠️ How to Set Up Locally and Run

### Step 1: Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anvithas2005/Quiz_Management_System.git 
cd Quiz_Management_System
```

### Step 2: Set Up Backend (Django)

```bash
python -m venv env
```
```bash
env\Scripts\activate   # (for Windows)
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 3: Set Up PostgreSQL Database

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running locally.

1. Open **pgAdmin** or run the following SQL in psql:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE quiz_db;
```

2. Make sure the database name, user, and password in `.env` match your PostgreSQL setup.

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root (`Quiz_Management_System/`) and add:

```env
DB_NAME=quiz_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key_here
```

### Step 5: Run Migrations and Start Backend

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

✅ Your Django API is running at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

### Step 6 Set Up Frontend (React)

```bash
cd quiz-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

✅ React frontend will run at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

This frontend is connected to the Django REST API using **Axios** and manages JWT tokens in local storage for secure authentication. Role-based routing is implemented using **React Router** and user context.

---

## 🧰 Frontend Libraries Used

1. **React.js** – Core framework for building the UI
2. **React Router DOM** – Enables routing between pages
3. **Axios** – Handles communication with Django API endpoints
4. **JWT Decode** – Decodes JWT tokens stored in local storage
5. **Context API** – Used to manage global user state and authentication
6. **React Hooks** – For state, side effects, and lifecycle handling
7. **Basic CSS** – Simple styling without external frameworks

---

## 🔐 How JWT Authentication Works

- This project uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure, stateless user authentication. Here's how it works:
- When a user logs in, the backend issues a **JWT token** that contains the user's ID and role (student or faculty).
- This token is saved in the browser's **local storage** and attached to every request using **Axios interceptors**.
- Based on the decoded token, the frontend performs **role-based routing** — sending faculty to the faculty dashboard and students to the quiz list.
- On logout, the token is removed from local storage, revoking access.
- The system is protected from unauthorized access by checking tokens in Django using **SimpleJWT** middleware and permissions.

🔒 This approach makes the system scalable, secure, and easy to extend for mobile or third-party clients.
